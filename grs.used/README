################ THE GRSs USED IN THE SEX-SPECIFIC GRSs PROJECT
################

Data taken from Pulit et al (PMID: 30239722; available here: https://github.com/lindgrengroup/fatdistnGWAS)
and from the GIANT 2015 Locke et al (PMID: 25673413) and Shungin et al (PMID: 25673412) datasets
(available here: https://portals.broadinstitute.org/collaboration/giant/index.php/GIANT_consortium_data_files)

1. [bmi/whr/whradjbmi].eur.[comb/men/women].pulit.sig.180513.txt
The sex-specific estimates (main) approach. Data taken from Pulit et al. Betas flipped to be positive, 
with corresponding flipping of alleles and EAFs.

SNP: rsID of SNP, then alleles in alphabetical order
Chr: Chromsome
Pos: Position in GRCh 37
EA: Effect allele 
NEA: Non-effect allele
psexdiff: Sexual heterogeneity P-value
frqA1.[combined/men/women]: Effect allele frequency in that sex group
beta.[combined/men/women]: Beta for that sex group (the weights used)
se.[combined/men/women]: Standard error for that sex group
pval.[combined/men/women]: P-value for that sex group
dir.[combined/men/women]: The original direction of effect in the cohorts (UKBB, GIANT) in Pulit et al. 
	Note not flipped according to positive betas and flipped alleles	
nmeta.[combined/men/women]: Meta-analysis sample size for that sex group
info.[combined/men/women]: Imputation info score from UKBB 

2. [bmi/whr/whradjbmi].eur.[men/women].pulit.180513.txt
The primary SNPs in each sex only approach. Data taken from Pulit et al. 
Betas flipped to be positive, with corresponding flipping of alleles and EAFs.

Column names as in the main sex-specific estimates approach. 

3. [bmi/whr/whradjbmi].eur.[men/women].pulit.[phet/0.01.fdr/0.05.fdr/0.1.fdr].180513.txt
The P-heterogeneity approaches. Data taken from Pulit et al.
Betas flipped to be positive, with corresponding flipping of alleles and EAFs.

File name explanation: 
phet = The critical P-value is based on a Bonferroni-correction
[0.01/0.05/0.1].fdr = The critical value is based on a 1%/5%/10% threshold of FDR-corrected P-values, correspondingly. 

Column names as in the sex-specific estimates approach, but the values in the "phet" columns
are from the sex-specific analyses if psexdiff < the critical P-value. Note that the psexdiff column in the
[bmi/whr/whradjbmi].eur.[combined/men/women].pulit.[0.01.fdr/0.05.fdr/0.1.fdr].180513.txt are 
the original P-values and not the FDR-corrected. 

4. [bmi/whr/whradjbmi].eur.[comb/men/women].pulit.winner.180513.txt
The approach using SNPs taken from the combined-sexes analysis. Data taken from Pulit et al. 
Betas flipped to be positive, with corresponding flipping of alleles and EAFs.

Column names as in the sex-specific estimates approach. 

5. [bmi/whr/whradjbmi].eur.comb.pulit.winner_unweigted.180513.txt
The approach using SNPs taken from the combined-sexes analysis, using unweighted allele scores. Data taken from Pulit et al.

Column names as in the sex-specific estimates approach, and effect alleles the 
same as in [bmi/whr/whradjbmi].eur.comb.pulit.winner.180513.txt, and all betas set to 1. 
	
5. [bmi/whr/whradjbmi].eur.[combined/men/women].giukbb.sig.180513.txt
The approach using weights from GIANT 2015 data. 
Betas flipped to be positive, with corresponding flipping of alleles and EAFs.

SNP: rsID of SNP, then alleles in alphabetical order
Chr: Chromsome
Pos: Position in GRCh 37
EA: Effect allele (from GIANT)
NEA: Non-effect allele (from GIANT)
beta: Beta for that sex group (the weights used) (from GIANT)
se: Standard error for that sex group (from GIANT)
p: P-value for that sex group (from GIANT)
n: Sample size (from GIANT)

6. [bmi/whr/whradjbmi].eur.[combined/men/women].internal.unweighted.180513.txt
The approach using unweighted allele scores
SNP: rsID of SNP, then alleles in alphabetical order
EA: Effect allele (same as in the main approach after beta flipping)
NEA: Non-effect allele (same as in the main approach after beta flipping)
CHR: Chromosome
BP: Position in GRCh 37
TEST: Dummy column
NMISS: Meta-analysis sample size for that sex group from main approach (kept as dummy)
BETA: The weight used (=1)
STAT: Dummy column 
P: P-value for that sex group from main approach (kept as dummy)
